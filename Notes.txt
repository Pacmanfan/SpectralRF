This is the SpectrumProfiler project.
It has several goals:
*-Use a single channel SDR through SoapySdr
*-perform RF sweeps
*-generate FFT data
*-allow the user to zoom in both in time and frequency space
-detect energy
-detect signals from energy
-allow user to save list of detect signals


Focus on speed and ability to scan huge amounts of spectrum
