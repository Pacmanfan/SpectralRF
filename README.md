This is the SpectralRF project
It is an SDR application that scans and sweeps the RF spectrum
Some goals:
    -Automatically Scan the RF spectrum
    -Find energy
    -Determine signal parameters
    -Automatically classify signals
    -support decoder/ demod / classification plugins

This project can act as a typical SDR decoding / demodulator application
